# Candidate Shortlisting Assignment – Python Test Automation Framework

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Python-based test automation framework
designed to simulate interaction with a VMware Avi Load Balancer API.

The framework follows a structured automation flow:
- Pre-Fetch
- Pre-Validation
- Task / Trigger
- Post-Validation

API authentication and calls are mocked to ensure stable and deterministic execution.
